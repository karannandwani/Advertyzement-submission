##The way it works
* ###I was reuired to fetch data from an API and display the data as a card grid. So that's what I did. I used axios to fetch the data and created a custom context data layer which had all the initial states and dispatch to tweak them. This web app is highly customizable especially due to this data layer. After that, displaying the data was pretty simple.
